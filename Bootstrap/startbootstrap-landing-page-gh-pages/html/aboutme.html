    <h4>Hawaii Trip</h4>

    <p class="box1">During my most recent trip to Hawaii in Novemeber, I got the opportunity to spend time with my family.
    The time spent with them involved a beautiful sunrise hike up to<span class="bold box1">Diamond Head</span> up to the top of the summit watching the sunrise over the ocean.
    After the sunrise hike another memorable part of visiting the island of Oahu was enjoying the beautiful <span class="bold box1 box2">Makaha Beach</span>where surfers and body boarders enjoy the large swells and the warm sunshine.
    My time in Hawaii spending time with family, connecting back to my culture, and making memorable moments and memories with my family at these beautiful destinations was truly incredible. </p>
